Project 1 - Number Guessing Game

For this first project we will be using Workspaces.

	#"""Psuedo-code Hints
	
	#When the program starts, we want to:
   # ------------------------------------
	#1. Display an intro/welcome message to the player.
	#2. Store a random number as the answer/solution.
	#3. Continuously prompt the player for a guess.
	  #a. If the guess greater than the solution, display to the player "It's lower".
	  #b. If the guess is less than the solution, display to the player "It's higher".
	
	#4. Once the guess is correct, stop looping, inform the user they "Got it"
		# and show how many attempts it took them to get the correct number.
	#5. Let the player know the game is ending, or something that indicates the game is over.
	
	#( You can add more features/enhancements if you'd like to. )

	# write your code inside this function.



# Kick off the program by calling the start_game function.
